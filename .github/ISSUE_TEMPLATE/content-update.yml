        ## üí° Implementation Guidance for Developers
        
        **Content Update Locations:**
        - Activity Data: `/src/backend/database.py` - `init_database()` function
        - Sample Activities: Look for the activities_collection initialization
        - Data Structure: Activities stored with name, description, schedule_details, participants, etc.
        
        **Key Files to Update:**
        - `/src/backend/database.py` - Main data source for activities
        - Verify changes appear in API endpoints at `/activities`
        - Test frontend displays updated content correctly
        
        **Update Process:**
        1. Locate the specific activity in the database initialization code
        2. Update the activity object with new information
        3. Ensure data structure remains consistent (schedule_details format, etc.)
        4. Test that existing functionality still works
        5. Verify participants list is preserved if applicable
        
        **Testing Checklist:**
        - [ ] Activity appears correctly on main page
        - [ ] Search and filtering still work with updated content
        - [ ] Registration process works with updated activity
        - [ ] No existing data is lost during update
        - [ ] Schedule format displays correctly (12-hour AM/PM format)
        
        **Data Structure Reference:**
        ```python
        {
            "_id": "activity-name",
            "name": "Display Name",
            "description": "Activity description",
            "schedule_details": {
                "days": ["Monday", "Wednesday"],

        ## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Guidance for Developers
        
        **UI/UX Implementation Files:**
        - HTML Structure: `/src/static/index.html`
        - Styling: `/src/static/style.css` (look for existing styles)
        - JavaScript Interactions: `/src/static/app.js`
        - Responsive Design: Check existing CSS media queries
        
        **Current Design Patterns:**
        - Activity cards are generated in JavaScript (`renderActivityCard` function)
        - Modal dialogs for registration and login
        - Filter sidebar with category, day, and time filters
        - Search functionality with real-time results
        
        **Key Functions to Review:**
        - `renderActivityCard()` - How activities are displayed
        - `displayFilteredActivities()` - How results are shown
        - `formatSchedule()` - How schedule info is formatted
        - CSS classes for `.activity-card`, `.filters`, `.modal`
        
        **UI/UX Best Practices to Follow:**
        - Maintain existing color scheme and branding
        - Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, contrast ratios)
        - Test responsive design on mobile devices
        - Keep loading performance optimal
        - Follow existing interaction patterns
        
        **Testing Suggestions:**
        - Test on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
        - Verify with browser zoom at 150% and 200%
        - Check color contrast for accessibility
        - Test with screen reader if possible
        - Validate HTML and CSS
        
        **Related Design Elements:**
        - Check existing button styles, form inputs, and cards
        - Review current typography and spacing
        - Consider existing filter and search interfaces
        - Look at modal dialog designs for consistency

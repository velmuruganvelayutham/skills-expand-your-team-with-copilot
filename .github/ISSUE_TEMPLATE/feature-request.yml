        ## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Guidance for Developers
        
        **Typical Implementation Areas:**
        - UI Changes: `/src/static/index.html` for new interface elements
        - JavaScript Logic: `/src/static/app.js` for filtering and interaction
        - Backend API: `/src/backend/routers/activities.py` for new endpoints if needed
        - Database: `/src/backend/database.py` for data structure changes if needed
        
        **Design Considerations:**
        - Follow existing UI patterns in the application
        - Ensure mobile responsiveness matches current design
        - Use consistent styling with existing filters
        - Consider performance impact on activity loading
        
        **Testing Suggestions:**
        - Test with various combinations of filters
        - Verify backwards compatibility with existing features
        - Test on different screen sizes and devices
        - Ensure feature works with all existing activities
        
        **Related Files to Review:**
        - UI/Frontend: `/src/static/index.html`, `/src/static/app.js`, `/src/static/style.css`
        - Backend: `/src/backend/routers/activities.py`
        - Sample Data: `/src/backend/database.py` (for understanding current data structure)
